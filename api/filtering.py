    1. For each of these skills, provide 10-15 terms inferring them from the skill that might appear in most job descriptions:
    {', '.join(skills)}. 
    2. The first term should be the skill itself. 
    3. Abbreviations/expansions of the skill should be included.
    4. The later terms should not contain the same words as the skill. 
    5. Make sure each term is distinct and doesn't overlap with the main skill name.
         
    Format your response as a JSON object where each skill is a key with an array of related terms.
